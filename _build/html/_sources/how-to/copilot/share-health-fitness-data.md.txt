You can give the CoPilot app permission to share health and fitness data with the Apple Health app.
For example, your CoPilot workout logs will appear in the Apple Health app and contribute to your fitness activity.
The CoPilot app can also read workout data from other apps like the Apple Workout app, allowing your coach to see activity occurring outside the CoPilot app.
You can grant access to your data, and remove access at any time in the Apple Health app settings.
You can also delete CoPilot data stored in Apple Health at any time.
