You can share fitness data tied to your Google account with the CoPilot app.
For example, your CoPilot workout logs will appear in the Google Fit app and contribute to your fitness activity.
The CoPilot app can also read data from the Google Fit app, allowing your coach to see activity occurring outside the CoPilot app.
You can grant access to your data, and remove access at any time in the Google Fit app settings.
You can also delete CoPilot data stored in Google Fit at any time.
